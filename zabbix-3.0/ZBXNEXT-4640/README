KEYCLAOK Feature is relate to a lot of PHP files..
So, create patch files for every modified-php files... 

1. Especially, the "index_callback.php.patch" is totally new-file,in /usr/share/zabbix/ directory.
2. vendor.tar.gz.patch, remove the "patch" suffix and UNtar this package into /usr/share/zabbix...
    2.1: this is a php-library developed by "Fran√ßois Kooman",https://gitlab.com/fkooman/php-oauth2-client
    2.2: Avoid the DB actions provided by this library due to zabbix has own DB actions
    2.3: I advise zabbix-official rewrite the functions of this library. 

3. welcome to post comments for this KEYCLOAK Feature.
